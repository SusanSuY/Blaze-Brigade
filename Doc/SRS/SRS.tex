\begin{itemize}
    \item The Blaze Brigade team
    \item[] The project will serve as a means of entertainment and project development experience to its developers.
    \item Tactics Heroes developers
    \item[] The game may serve as a guideline to the original developers of Tactics Heroes to further improve their game by incorporating our projectâ€™s additional add-on features, as well as modern software development tools and concepts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
\textbf{Description:} The game shall support Windows OS. \\
\textbf{Rationale:} The client will access the game using a device running Windows. \\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The game shall be developed to support Windows operating systems, and testing will ensure that the game runs smoothly on any  version of Windows OS newer and including Windows XP.

\subsubsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
The product will be utilizing XNA Game Studio for game development, Adobe Photoshop for graphic editing, and Audacity and FL Studio for music and sound editing. A device that is able to run Visual Studio with XNA Game Studio is also required for project development. Customers must be in possession of a Windows machine to be able to play the game, and a pointing device to be able to select items on the screen.

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
Full development of the game does not have any applicable schedule constraints. However, the basic functions of the game must be fully completed by December 2016.

\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
The budget for the project is \$0 as all software required for development is provided for free. In addition, all hardware required is already owned by the project's respective developers.

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

\subsubsection{Relevant Facts}
The game that Blaze Brigade will re-implement, Tactics Heroes, was initially named Fire Emblem Factory. The game is heavily influenced from a Japanese game series called Fire Emblem, which was released in 1990 by Intelligent Systems and Nintendo. Fire Emblem revolutionized the genre by incorporating RPG elements, and as such, the success of the genre in modern day can largely be attributed to this series. In addition, Tactics Heroes is still in alpha stage, and only basic gameplay have been fully implemented. Future content for additional features in Tactics Heroes is still under works by its developers.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
It is assumed that upon project launch, the host site for the game's download will be free. It is also assumed that members of the general public will not use any aspect of the project or its source code for malicious intent or for resale for monetary value.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}
Video games are a popular source of entertainment in our society, and tactical RPGs can be traced back to the classics in 1980s. Therefore Blaze Brigade will be a new entertaining game with a throwback on nostalgia. The objective of Blaze Brigade is to move and order your units to defeat all of the enemy player's controllable units. The game will incorporate common tactical RPG features such as path finding, RNG, animations, sound effects, and unique weapons and unit types. 

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}
The game will be available to play on all desktop and laptop capable of running Windows (or Windows VM), and will be packaged and deployed through Visual Studio. The developers will first develop a working game, and will then allow others to use and evaluate the prototype. Afterwards, the developers will use the feedback to refine the code further and repeat the evaluation process. These evaluation stages are crucial for developing software that meets the customers' preferences, as the game should be fun and entertaining for those who play it.

\subsection{Health and Safety Requirement}

The patterns of lights from the game screen can result in epilepsy seizures and/or blackouts to a very small percentage of individuals. This may occur in individuals with no past history of seizures of blackout.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
The developers of Blaze Brigade must become familiarized with the C++ programming language and investigate how to efficiently adapt to the specific coding standard and testing methodologies. With the use of new technologies, such as a XNA Game Studio, additional time would need to be allocated to learn this tool in depth. In addition, a feasibility study is yet to be completed to indicate whether a mouse-only control would be a feasible for all the possible scenarios present throughout the game play.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
Blaze Brigade makes use of Tactics Heroes, an open source program that motivates the creation of a tactical simulation role-playing game. The engine streamlines the process of implementing the framework, and the developers of Blaze Brigade would simply need to implement maps, units, characters and the storyline. In addition, the open-source program presents a software license agreement and encourages developers to contribute to the program by getting involved within the forums.

\subsection{New Problems}
No new problems are tracked at this stage of the project.

\subsection{Tasks}
\subsubsection{Project Planning}
The game shall be completed using the prospective timeline:

\noindent
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{llX}
    \toprule
    Task & Resource & Start Date \\
    \midrule
    Problem Statement & Developers  & Sept 20 \\
    Development Plan & Developers  & Sept 26 \\
    Requirements Document - Revision 0 & Developers & Oct 4 \\
    Test Plan - Revision 0 & Developers  & Oct 21 \\

    Implement final changes from survey feedback & Developers & Nov 28 \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Project Planning Timeline}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Planning of the Development Phases}

The tasks listed in the table above will serve as the main guide for the developers to ensure that deliverable are completed in correct succession. In that regard, the output will serve the purpose to ensure that all of the requirements have been met before starting the next iteration of development phase. In addition to the development phases, documents such as Problem Statement, Development Plan, Software Requirements Specification, Design Document, and Test Plan would need to be created and updated concurrently for the stakeholders as the project proceeds.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
The project will be made available to the general public through GitHub, and serves as an improvement to the original product. Thus, migration to the new product heavily depends on its users' choice to migrate to Blaze Brigade by downloading a copy of the game from GitHub.

\subsection{Risks}
The risk associated with the project comes with the nature of developing a game. For instance, accommodating testing into the game play would be a time-consuming and trivial task. Hence, the investigation on how to proceed with a specific testing standard and whether to introduce an automated testing framework is still underway at this stage of the project. In relation to the design aspect, a feasibility study is yet to be completed to indicate whether a mouse-only control would be feasible throughout all the scene of the game play. Another risk is that while the code structure for each module has been designed to add future additions seamlessly, there is a slight chance newer additions might conflict with existing implementations. In addition, extra time would need to be allocated in the process of learning and adapting to new technologies to ensure all of the objectives are met in the constrained time frame.

\subsection{Costs}
There is no cost associated in the development of the product. The developers of Blaze Brigade will make best use of their personal computers for the main development environment, with the addition of already-owned tools such as XNA Game Studio and Adobe Photoshop.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}

\subsubsection{Training Requirements}
Readable instructions will be available to the player at the beginning of the game, and will carefully instruct the user on how to play Blaze Brigade. 

\subsection{Waiting Room}
There are a few extra features that would increase the entertainment value of the game but have yet to be implemented. One major addition would be an AI that a player can face, instead of the game always requiring 2 players. Another would be another game mode called "Capture the Flag", where you would attempt to capture objective flags on the map, and bring it back to your base without that unit dying and losing the flag. Unit level increasing is also another feature that will be implemented in the future, as well as a larger variety of unit types. An additional feature to be implemented will be more weapon types as well as weapon animation during attacking. A further feature would be adding different tile weights, such as costing two movement to walk through a water tile. The last extra feature would be a playable tutorial upon starting the game replacing the screen of instructions on how to play.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
The path finding algorithm used for unit moving and attacking currently is breadth-first search. However, this would only work since we do not yet account for weighted tiles (costing more then 1 movement to go through a tile). This would turn it into a weighted graph, and we would need to instead switch to Dijkstra's algorithm for path finding.

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters} \label{Actions}

\subsubsection{Moving}
Moving refers to selecting 'Move" from a selected unit, then clicking to one of the blue highlighted nodes to move the unit from its previous location to the location newly clicked.

\subsubsection{Equip Weapon}
Equip weapon refers to selecting a different weapon from the Item drop down menu, which in turn changes the unit's stats for damage calculations.

\subsubsection{Attack}
Attack refers to selecting attack from the character drop down menu, and clicking on an enemy unit positioned on a red highlighted node. The unit will then deal damage to the enemy unit based on damage calculation then be counterattacked by that same unit should it survive.

\subsubsection{Killing a Unit}
Killing a unit refers to a unit getting attacked and having its health being reduced to under 0. That unit is then "killed" and no longer playable or seen in the current game.

\subsection{Unit Terminology} \label{UnitType}

For unit structure, refer to Section \ref{unitStructure} in the functional requirements.

\subsubsection{Warrior}
Warriors are a front-line physical bruiser and tank. They can equip swords, move quickly, and attack units within adjacent range. Their high attack and defense allows them to kill archers and mage easily once in range, but can fall prey to mages due to their lower resistance.

\subsubsection{Archer}
Archers are a back-line ranged physical attacker. They can equip bows giving them an attack range of 2 or 3. Their long range is compensated by the fact that they cannot counterattack against adjacent units. Their high attack and skill allows them to accurately land high physical attacks with a potent critical rate. This makes them the ideal unit for killing off mages, although they struggle against warriors.

\subsubsection{Mage}
Mages are a back-line ranged magical attacker. They can equip different spell tomes giving them an attack range of 1-2. Although their mobility is limited, their extremely dangerous magical attacks allows them to easily kill off warriors, despite struggling against archers.

\subsection{Combat Terminology} \label{Combat}
For attacking with units, refer to Section \ref{Attacking} in the functional requirements. \\ \\
For unit x = attacking unit, and unit y = defending unit where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item unit.skill gets the unit's skill.
    \item unit.str gets the unit's strength.
    \item unit.int gets the unit's int.
    \item unit.def gets the unit's defense.
    \item unit.res gets the unit's resistance.
    \item unit.spd gets the unit's speed.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hit Rate}
The percentage chance that a unit will land an attack. \\
hitRate calculation= [(x.skill/10 - y.skill/10)+1]*0.8 *100, \\
where hitRate is 80\% if both players have the same skill, and adds or subtracts 8\% to hitRate in favour of the unit with the higher skill stat.

\subsubsection{Critical Rate}
The percentage chance that a unit will perform a critical attack (attack that deals x2 damage). \\
critRate=[(x.skill/3 - y.skill/3)+1]*0.81*100, \\
where critRate is 10 if both players have the same skill, and adds or subtracts 3.33\% to critRate in favour of the unit with the higher skill stat.

\subsubsection{Physical Damage}
The amount of damage a physical unit deals should an attack hit before modifiers. \\
physicalDamage = x.strength - y.defense, \\
where physical damage is the damage calculated from a physical attack.

\subsubsection{Magical Damage}
The amount of damage a magical unit deals should an attack hit before modifiers. \\
magicalDamage = x.int - y.res, \\
where physical damage is the damage calculated from a magical attack.

\subsubsection{Number of Hits}
The number of attacks a unit will perform when attacking. \\
numHits = 2 if x.spd is greater than y.spd+4, else numHits = 1.

\subsubsection{Damage Dealt}
The amount of damage actually inflicted on an enemy unit when a unit performs an attack. \\
damageDealt = (physicalDamage or magicalDamage) * numHits * (hitRate, which will be 1 if the attack hits or 0 if the attack misses) * (1.5 if it is a critical hit or 1 if it is not a critical hit).
